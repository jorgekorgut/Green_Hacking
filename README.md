This project aims to analyze ground metrics within banks to correlate them with predefined goals like company growth, carbon footprint reduction, and bolstering corporate brand image. It incorporates measurable variables such as telework and vegetarian meal rates per week. By examining the relationships among diverse ground metrics in the banking sector, the project facilitates predictive modeling and constraint application to ensure predefined objectives are achieved. For instance, it prevents a decline in environmental footprint if company growth surpasses a specified threshold.
